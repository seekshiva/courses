<h3>Story of CoursesHub</h3>

	<strong>Hi everyone</strong>,
	<p>I'm Vignesh (Final year ECE), one of the contributors of 'courseshub'. This is the story of the app, it all began during the NASA 2013 hackathon. During our journey to Bangalore, Shiva Nandan (aka seek), my Delta senior discussed with me about an app that will bridge the gap between faculties and students. He had already developed a prototype with very basic feature, the app with its partially finished features was already impressive. He wanted someone to work on the rest of the app and complete it. Unlike other Delta projects no one volunteered for this one. The problem was that he built the prototype with the then new technologies which no one in the club has worked on, so we were reluctant to take up the task. Shortly after Pragyan I was jobless so I volunteered and promised to complete it during summer vacations but ended up doing nothing. </p>
	<p>Due to the tough competition that I faced while getting a summer intern and the fact that I come from a non compsci branch made me fear that spending time on the app would affect my placements. Sadly I dropped out of the app and did my intern and the development process remained idle for about 6 months. </p>
	<p>I resumed my work in late October,2013. I was re-factoring code and redesigned the database schema and was passively contributing, but I was keen on persuading some of my batch mates and juniors to work on the app. The development work gained friction just before my semester exam. After spending my entire winter holidays on the app, here it is.</p>

	<strong>To Students:</strong>
	<p>The app was completed hastily and I had no time to test it across various screen sizes and browsers. Please let me know if you feel that something is not working properly or if there is some design issue. The app is supposed to work with out any page reloads except for static pages and login page. If you find anything wrong please let me know, don't hesitate to contact me, it can even be very simple like a box not having a rounded corner. </p>

	<strong>To Faculties:</strong>
	<p>I know that it is a burden on you and you definetly have to put in extra effort to record all the class activities but on the brighter side you have to do it only once and the records will be maintained for years. Even after 10 years you will be able see what you have taught and what the questions were like. This would be helpful during accrediation process.</p>

	<strong>To Critics:</strong>
	<p>Some people say that you guys are good for nothing and you can only talk and never do something abt it,  but I'm a little open minded. I think you guys play an important role in the evolution of the app and help us maintain high standards. I'm open to critism, please mail me if you have anything or if you choose to be anonymous put it up on NITT Confessions.</p>

	<strong>To Developers:</strong>
	<p>The app is still short on man power. Any opensource contribution is deeply appriciated. Source code is available on github, if you are interested in learning about the app or contributing to it, please contact me. </p>

	<strong>To Hackers/Crackers:</strong>
	<p>I think the app has all precautionary measure to shield it from any kind of attack. As far as I know the app has protection against CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection, etc. You mighthave guessed from the source but still, backbone and bootstrap on the front end, rails 4 on the back end deployed using unicorn server with 2 simultaneos process workers, usual rails app memory footprint, MySQL database and paperclip gem for image processing . All the best!</p>
